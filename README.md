## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site.
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin.

## My process

I used vanilla CSS and HTML with an opensource javascript framework called leaflet.js. A desktop-first approach was used.


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- fontawesome
- Google fonts
- Leaflet.js
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- BEM CSS (attempted this method of organizing my code but it was hard to follow. So naming convention is half BEM and half normal.)


### What I learned

I realized that working on this project, a little more planning out the layout will help. I tried using CSS Grid and that didn't go well. From that I see some deficits my learning and for areas of improvement. Next project I'll be getting a better handle on CSS Grid. 

For the photo grid on the homepage I scrapped some code and re-coded the parts to make it more manageable for controlling a flexible layout. 

Lastly, I learned quite a bit about using relative units and viewport widths and heights. This is my first responsive web project, it was a challenge to manage alignment. At first it felt like a game of Whacka-a-mole. I'd be making adjustments based on different screen sizes for one section, only realizing having to go back and make adjustments in an area I thought I had completed, needed refinements.

But I loved every minute of it. 


### Continued development

In the future, I want to focus on CSS Grid, relative values and units, and more integrations and using javascript. Lastly, I'd make my HTML less convoluted, I will try to avoid nesting elements, all the time and using a mobile-first approach. 


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.layoutit.com/) This helped me for building the css grid.
- [resource 2](https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples) This site really helped me with getting some button styling inspiration. I did some modification for my buttons for this project. 
- [resource 3](https://chat.openai.com/) ChatGPT was used for some coding sections. My approach was to use ChatGPT for short code snippets and examples as well as explaining concepts. 
- [resource 4](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) Kevin Powell's YouTube channel is an awesome resource, enjoyed digging down to get specific clarification but also perusing.
- [resource 5](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) Since I used mostly Flexbox, this graphic chart helped me internalize the behaviour of Flexbox.
